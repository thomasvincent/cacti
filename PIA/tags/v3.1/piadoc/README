----[ Installation ]

    Apply this patch to a freshly installed cacti installation, before configuring Cacti
    If you use this patch with a RPM distribution, instead of from source, then you may
    encounter errors with the patching (most likely in global.php).  If so, then please use
    the already patched files that are included with this.

    In general we prefer you to use the 'full files' method of installing the Plugin 
    architecture.  However, with some distributions, some of Cacti's 'base' files 
    are moved.  This is generall limited to differences in the following two files:

    global.php, config.php

    So, care must be given when updating those two files.  Otherwise, it's generally
    safe to update from 'full files'.

    However, the patch is still a viable option.  To install using the patch, drop 
    the patch into your cacti directory, and then use this command on unix
    to patch your cacti files.

    patch -p1 -N < cacti-plugin-0.8.7g-PA-v3.0.diff

    After you have applied either the full files, or the patch, follow the procedure
    below to complete the installation:

    Edit config.php and update the $url_path variable.  It's generally set to '/cacti/'.
    Including the trailing slash is very important.

    Import the pa.sql file using syntax simliar to the syntax below:

    mysql [-u<username> -p<password> -h<hostname>] cacti < pa.sql
