Prerequisites:

CYGWIN

 1. Download Cygwin for Window from http://www.cygwin.com/
 2. Install Cygwin by executing the downloaded setup program
 3. Basically, select install from Internet
 4. Select the installation location
 5. Select a mirror which is close to your location
 6. Once on the package selection section make sure to select the following:
	autoconf
	automake
	gcc-core
	gzip
	libtool
	make
	net-snmp-devel
	m4
	libmysqlclient-devel
	libmysqlclient
	openssl-devel
	dos2unix
	wget
 7. Wait for installation to complete, coffee time!


Compiling Spine:

 1. Open Cygwin shell prompt and brace yourself to use unix commands on windows.
 2. Download the Spine source to the current directory:
	wget http://www.cacti.net/downloads/spine/cacti-spine-0.8.8g.tar.gz
 3. Untar Spine:
	tar xzvf cacti-spine-0.8.8g.tar.gz
 3. Change into the Spine directory:
	cd cacti-spine-0.8.8g
 4. Run bootstrap to prepare Spine for compilation:
	./bootstrap
 5. Follow the instruction which bootstrap will output if all is good to go.
 6. Update the spine.conf file for your installation of Cacti. You can optionally 
    move it to a better location if you choose to do so, make sure to copy the
    spine.conf as well.
 7. Ensure that spine runs well by running with `/usr/local/spine/spine -R -S -V 3`
 8. Update your Paths to point to the spine binary and update your poller type to spine.
    For the spine binary on Windows x64, and using default locations, that would be 
	'C:\cygwin64\usr\local\spine\bin\spine.exe'
 9. In the Cacti Settings -> Poller update the path to Spine and switch the
    Poller Type to Spine.
10. If all is good Spine will be run from the poller in place of cmd.php.
